# 42matters Categorization of Apps

This solution enables you to categorize apps into meaningful clusters based on 42matters' technology. There are 2 possible ways to get app categories back:

## Option 1) API call

### Prerequisites
* Your app has access to internet.

### How to get app categories

1. Your client app makes an HTTPS request to our API endpoint: https://42matters.com/api/1/apps/cluster.json?appID=YOUR_APP_ID. In the POST request you specify the app (or list of apps) that needs to be categorized.
2. 42matters will respond with a JSON object containing for each package name (i.e. app) the related category/cluster.

## Option 2) SDK Integration

### Prerequisites
* Your app has a minimum sdk level of 7 (Android 2.1).
* You have an account on https://42matters.com.
* You registered your app under the **Profiler** section, and you have its appID

### Integrate the library

1. Reference the library project (if you are using Eclipse, import the library into your workspace first). The library project is provided to the partner by 42matters.

2. Configure your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` like this

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <manifest ... >

    	<uses-sdk ... />

		<!-- 42matters apps categorization permissions -->
		<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
	
		<application ... >
			<activity ... />
		
			<!-- 42matters apps categorization data -->
			<meta-data
				android:name="42:appid"
				android:value="YOUR_APP_ID" />
		</application>

    </manifest>
    ```

    Replace **YOUR_APP_ID** with the appID you get after registering your app.

### How to get app categories

The SDK will do communicating with our cloud to retrieve the categories for a set of apps:

1. Your client app makes a call to `FortyTwo.getAppCategories(List<String> package_names)` and get a JSON object back. The JSON object contains for each package name (i.e. app) the related category/cluster.
2. Your client app calls our tracking method (`FortyTwo.asyncRegisterCategory(Context context, String packageName, String newFolder)` to register when a users moves an app to another folder: this will help us improve users' future experience.

## Data transmitted
Both the API and SDK approach require the following data to properly categorize apps:

* List of **apps to categorize**
	* For each app we need: package name, app version, first installation time (optional), is pre-installed app (true/false)
* **Country** of the user (i.e. reverse geocoded from IP address)
* **Device information**: manufacturer, model, OS version, language, screen size and density
