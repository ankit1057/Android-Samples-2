# 42matters SDK for Android Recommendations

This library enables you to provide Android app recommendations to your users.

## How to integrate

### Prerequisites
* Your app has a minimum sdk level of 7 (Android 2.1).
* You have an account on https://42matters.com.
* You registered your app under the **Profiler** section, and you have its appID

### Integrate the library

1. Reference the library project (if you are using Eclipse, import the library into your workspace first). The library project is provided to the partner by 42matters.

2. Call `FortyTwo.init(Context context)` from the `onCreate` of your launcher activity or Application subclass. This call is asynchronous.

	```java
	@Override
	protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
		FortyTwo.init(this);
		...
	}
	```
4. Configure your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` like this

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <manifest ... >

    	<uses-sdk ... />

		<!-- 42matters app recommendation permissions -->
		<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
		<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
	
		<application ... >
			<activity ... />
		
			<!-- 42matters app recommendation componenets -->

			<service android:name="fortytwo.android.lib.Service" />

			<receiver
				android:name="fortytwo.android.lib.Receiver"
				android:exported="true"
				android:process=":offui" >
				<intent-filter>
					<category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />

					<action android:name="android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED" />
					<action android:name="android.intent.action.PACKAGE_REMOVED" />

					<data android:scheme="package" />
				</intent-filter>
			</receiver>

			<!-- 42matters app recommendation data -->
			<meta-data
				android:name="42:appid"
				android:value="YOUR_APP_ID" />
		</application>

    </manifest>
    ```

    Replace **YOUR_APP_ID** with the appID you get after registering your app.



## How to get recommendations

The SDK will do the analyzing of users' app and communicating with our cloud to compute the recommendations. There are 2 possible ways to get recommendations back.

### Option 1) Get the recommendations within your CLIENT

1. Your client app makes a call to `FortyTwo.getRecommendations(Context context)` and get a JSON object back. The JSON object would look like what we provide through our [Android app search api](https://42matters.com/api/search), so you could use it to directly populate the views.
2. Your client app calls our tracking methods (`FortyTwo.asyncRegisterImpression(Context context, String packageName, String recommendationId)` and `FortyTwo.asyncRegisterClick(Context context, String packageName, String recommendationId)`) to register how users interact with the recommendations: this will help us improve users' future experience.

### Option 2) Get the recommendations through SERVER-TO-SERVER communication

1. Your client app gets the user's identifier by calling `FortyTwo.getUserId(Context context)` and then send this id up to your server.
2. Your server send this id to our cloud end point and retrieve a list of recommendations.
3. Your server customize the list (e.g., adding your reviews and ratings) and return it to the client app.
4. Your client app calls our tracking methods (`FortyTwo.asyncRegisterImpression(Context context, String packageName, String recommendationId)` and `FortyTwo.asyncRegisterClick(Context context, String packageName, String recommendationId)`) to register how users interact with the recommendations: this will help us improve users' future experience.
 
### Data transmitted
The SDK is a convenient way to request app recommendations from 42matters' cloud. The SDK takes care of data compression and encryption and provides an easy way to send to 42matters the required data to compute the recommendations:

* List of **installed apps**
	* For each app we need: package name, app version, first installation time (optional), is pre-installed app (true/false)
* **Country** of the user (i.e. reverse geocoded from IP address)
* **Device information**: manufacturer, model, OS version, language, free space (in MB), screen size and density
* Usage data (optional): time spent within each app

In case the SDK cannot be integrated within your app, we can provide code snippets to communicate to 42matters' cloud, essentially HTTPS requests POSTing the previously mentioned data.
